Cryptoflow
==========

Cryptoflow *will be* a didactic cryptography environment with an emphasis on exploration.

In plain language, it will be a bunch of boxes and lines, put together to form cryptographic
constructs, much like you would find them illustrated in text books. Unlike the textbook
models, however, Cryptoflow models will be explorable: run a construct with some input,
see its output; click the construct to explore its innards, the parts that make it up.

In more academic terms Cryptoflow will be a browser-based data flow programming language
and environment, with a standard library consisting only of the constructs needed to build
modern cryptographic elements.

It is the product of a 7,5 ECTS (quarter of a semester) project at the IT-University of
Copenhagen, and the first version will be ready at the end of 2017. Along with the first
version of the project, a report will be produced. Check that out at [hypesystem/Cryptoflow-report](https://github.com/hypesystem/Cryptoflow-report)

Will the project end at end of semester 2017? I sure hope not! I would love your contributions
and thoughts along the way.

## Contributing

If you have a question about the project, or if anything is unclear, please feel free
to [open an issue](https://github.com/hypesystem/Cryptoflow/issues/new). I am very open
to all questions at this point of the project.

Right now, a lot of ground work is going on, so it might be slightly hard to contribute
with anything very concrete, but if you let yourself be known, I will be sure to ping you
once anything reviewable exists. I am also very open to pointers towards related research.
